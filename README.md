# --DigiCreate a Digital Phone Book ðŸ“ž

**Statement**
Earlier, we use to have a phone book, which consists of contact numbers. Now that we
know the power of python, let's create a digital phonebook.
What does that mean?
This means we have to create a menu-driven console application, where multiple users
can create their account,
We have to create an authentication system :
1. Registration
2. Login (If user is already registered)
After successful authentication, user should have right to
1. Add contacts
2. Read all contacts
3. Read any specific contact
4. Update any specific contact
5. Delete any specific contact
6. Delete all contactstal-Phone-Book.
